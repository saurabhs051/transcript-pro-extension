- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No browsing history
- ❌ No YouTube viewing data
- ❌ No search queries

## How the Extension Works

TranscriptPro operates entirely **locally on your device**:

2. All transcript processing happens in your browser
3. No data is sent to external servers
4. No data is stored beyond your current session

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access the current YouTube video page
- **tabs**: To detect when you navigate to a new video
- **scripting**: To extract transcript data from YouTube's page

These permissions are used solely to provide the transcript download functionality. No data is collected or transmitted.

## User Preferences

Your formatting preferences (timestamps on/off, clean formatting, etc.) are only stored in memory during your current session. When you close the extension popup, preferences reset to defaults. No persistent data is stored.
