# Cursor Rules for this Project

## Documentation Policy
- **NO excessive documentation files**
- Maximum 1 documentation file if absolutely critical
- Delete temporary/test documentation files when done
- Do NOT create: README, STATUS, GUIDE, TROUBLESHOOTING, TEST-RESULTS, SUMMARY, or multiple similar files
- If documentation is truly needed, consolidate into ONE file maximum

## File Creation Policy
- Minimize number of files created
- Reuse and modify existing files whenever possible
- Only create new files when absolutely necessary
- Delete temporary files after completing tasks

## Debugging Approach
- Add extensive logging to code instead of creating documentation
- Focus on code and functionality, not documentation
- Use console.log statements for debugging

## Code Focus
- Prioritize working code over documentation
- Keep things clean and minimal
- Remove redundant files immediately

## Testing Requirements - CRITICAL
- **NEVER trust automated tests alone for customer-facing output**
- **ALWAYS validate visual/rendered output manually**
- For PDFs: Extract and inspect actual text content, check for encoding issues
- For exports: Verify special characters render correctly (emojis, currency symbols)
- Test as if you're a paying customer who knows nothing about code
- Check for: garbage characters, missing content, broken formatting, wrong data
- Automated tests check "does it work?", manual inspection checks "does it look professional?"
- One visual bug destroys customer trust - catch them ALL before shipping
- **Check for placeholder URLs/domains in output** - Remove funnelgeneratorpro.com, example.com, yoursite.com, etc. if you don't own them
- **Verify all URLs and contact info** in customer-facing content are valid or removed

## Product Development Strategy
- **Build desktop apps with Electron** for maximum reach and ease of use
- Target ALL platforms: Windows, Mac (Intel + ARM), Linux
- No user installations required (Node.js, npm, etc.) - apps must be standalone
- One-click installation: Download → Double-click → Works
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated multi-platform builds
- Set up proper releases with version tags (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
- Always build for cross-platform compatibility from day 1
- Avoid platform-specific code or emojis/symbols that don't render universally
